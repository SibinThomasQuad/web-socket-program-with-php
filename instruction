IN CLIENT PHP FIle
7

I have tried this project alongside Ratchet, and it works perfectly as a PHP client:

https://github.com/Textalk/websocket-php

Install with: composer require textalk/websocket 1.0.*

And a usage example:

<?php

require('vendor/autoload.php');

use WebSocket\Client;

$client = new Client("ws://127.0.0.1:1234");
$client->send("Hello from PHP");

echo $client->receive() . "\n"; // Should output 'Hello from PHP'
